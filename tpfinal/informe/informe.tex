% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 12pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{graphicx}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
%\else
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
%\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introducción}

\IEEEPARstart{L}{a} navegación de robots es el área encargada de desarrollar robots capaces de desplazarse de forma autónoma. La utilización de esta tecnología se utiliza en distintos ámbitos como por ejemplo:  misiones espaciales, misiones militares, asistencia para personas con discapacidades e inclusive como guias en una exposición.

El objetivo del presente trabajo es desarrollar un algoritmo de navegación de robots utilizando visión estéreo. En la actualidad, existen diversas técnicas de visión por computadora que nos brindan la información necesaria sobre el entorno en el que se encuentra el robot para que este pueda tomar la mejor decisión posible. Algunos ejemplos de estas técnicas son: utilización de cámaras tipo eyebird enfocando todo el terreno, generación de mapas a través de las imágenes tomadas o también reconocimiento de objetos a través de imágenes. El enfoque de este trabajo consiste, principalmente, en utilizar mapas de disparidad para obtener información sobre la distancia entre el robot y los objetos que luego será utilizada por el robot para decidir el próximo movimiento a realizar. Un paper que ha influido fuertemente el presente trabajo fue \"Region of Interest in Disparity Mapping for Navigation of Stereo Vision Autonomous Guided Vehicle\". Este paper posee un enfoque similar a este, en cuanto a las técnicas de visión utilizadas. Las diferencias radican en la interpretación de la información que nos brindan los mapas de disparidad.

El presente trabajo describe los fundamentos teóricos y prácticos utilizados para lograr la navegación de un robot, en particular del exabot (poner link, foto o alguna referencia). Cabe destacar que el entorno utilizado juega un papel fundamental en el buen desempeño del algoritmo, utilizamos un entorno llano iluminado para no perder ningún dato al tomar cada fotografía. La cámara se encuentra en la parte superior del frente del robot y su movilidad se reduce a avanzar, retroceder y rotar sobre su propio eje.

Por último, dejaremos ideas para alguna posible continuación.

\section{Calibración de la cámara estéreo}
Cuando capturamos una escena del mundo (tres dimensiones) con una cámara, ésta se proyecta sobre una imagen en dos dimensiones.\\
Para conocer la posición de cada punto es necesario definir un sistema de referencias, es decir, los tres ejes principales con su origen, sus orientaciones y sus unidades.

Existen tres sistemas de referencias posibles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item El sistema del mundo: independiente de la cámara. Unidades físicas, por ejemplo, metros.
	\item El sistema de la cámara: origen en el centro óptico. Unidades físicas.
	\item El sistema de la imagen: origen en la esquina de la imagen. Unidades en pixeles.
\end{itemize}

Los parámetros intrínsecos son los que relacionan el sistema de referencia de la cámara con el sistema de referencia de la imagen y los parámetros extrínsecos son los que relacionan el sistema de referencia del mundo con el sistema de referencia de la cámara.

El sistema de referencia de la cámara y el sistema de referencia del mundo tienen las mismas unidades. Lo que cambia es el origen y la orientación de los ejes. Esto significa que la conversión de un sistema al otro  implica una traslación (cambio de origen) y una rotación (cambio de orientación).Ver figura 1.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{C:/Users/aolmedo/Documents/informeRobotica/tpfinal/informe/figuras/fig9.png}
		\caption{Parámetros extrínsecos}
\end{figure}

Por otro lado, el sistema de referencia de la cámara y el sistema de referencia de la imagen no tienen las mismas unidades. Con lo cual hay que realizar un cambio de unidad, dividiendo por el tamaño del pixel. Además hay que cambiar el lugar del origen sumando la posición del centro de la imagen. Ver figura 2.

Los parámetros intrínsecos de una cámara son los atributos que posee la misma, como la distancia focal, punto principal, skew,  distorción de los lentes, etc.

%La cámara y el mundo tienen medidas fisicas como por ejemplo: metros.
%La imagen tiene medidas en pixeles.

La calibración de una cámara es el procedimiento por el cual obtenemos los parámetros intrínsecos y extrínsecos de la cámara a partir de imágenes tomadas por la misma.

%Por otro lado, los parámetros extrínsecos relaciona el sistema de coordenadas del mundo al de la camara. Estos se utilizan %para formar la transformación que mapea los puntos 3D del mundo, a los puntos 2D de la cámara.

Una vez que obtenemos los parámetros intrínsecos y extrínsecos, podemos decir que la
cámara esta calibrada, pudiendo representar cualquier punto del mundo real sobre el plano 2D de la cámara.

%{explicacion de cada figura y decir que si no calibramos cada punto proyectado no se reflejaria bien en la camara, decir que %usamos una camara pinhole}

Para el desarrollo del presente trabajo utilizamos una camara estéreo, con lo cual no nos alcanza solo con calibrar cada una de las cámaras, sino que además debemos calibrar las dos cámaras de forma conjunta. A esto se lo denomina calibración estéreo.

La calibración estéreo nos provee los parámetros intrínsecos de cada cámara (que son los obtenidos en la calibración de cada una) y los parámetros extrínsecos, que nos definen la posición relativa de las cámaras.

Para realizar dicha calibración utilizamos un toolbox de calibración de cámaras para matlab \footnote{http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib\_doc/}. Dicha herramienta necesita una serie de fotos para realizar la calibración.

%Como dijimos anteriormente, vamos a utilizar fuertemente mapa de disparidad. Para ello necesitamos calibrar las camaras %utilizadas. La razón por la cual calibramos es para obtener datos feacientes (reales) de las distancias de las camaras, ya sea %en profundidad como también sobre el plano proyectado. La calibración se realiza en dos etapas:

%Primera: se realiza calibracion sobre el plano proyectado. Para ello se utiliza un damero de 30 cm y tomamos distintas %fotografias moviendo la perspectiva del damero. Luego con la herramienta Matlab marcamos las distintas puntas del damero de %cada fotografia. Procesamos estas imagenes con la herramienta y nos devuelve los parametros incrinsicos (CHEQUEAR) de la %camara. Estos nos serviran para poder vincular un punto de una imagen con correspondencia con el otro.

%Segundo: se realiza calibración sobre dos imagenes tomadas en el momento de utilizar el programa de navegación. Esto se %realiza para poder saber la profundidad obtenida por las camaras. Esto se debe realizar en cada momento de correr el software %porque varia considerablemente el mapa de disparidad. Si este paso esta descalibrado; el mapa de disparidad, que es la base %del algoritmo, va a mostrar datos erroneos.

\section{Imagen estéreo}
Al proyectarse los objetos, de un espacio tridimensional a una imagen bidimensional se pierde la información de la distancia a la cámara o profundidad (eje Z) de cada punto. Una forma de tratar de recuperar esta información es mediante el uso de dos cámaras, en lo que se conoce como visión estéreo.

\subsection{Calculo del mapa de disparidad}

En esta seccion explicaremos los pasos ha realizar para obtener un mapa de disparidad  a partir de dos imágenes capturadas por la cámara estéreo.

Básicamente, se buscan correspondencias entre los puntos que se encuentran en una imagen y los mismos puntos en la otra imagen. Con estas correspondencias y conocienfo la distancia entre las camaras(linea base) podemos calcular la ubicacion en 3 dimensiones de los puntos.

Para conseguir el mejor resultado posible eliminaremos la distorsion radial y tangencial de las imagenes obtenidas con la camara minoru. Ademas  se ajusta los angulos y distancias entre las camaras para que los planos de las imagenes queden coplanares. A este ultimo paso se lo conoce con el nombre de rectificacion. (mejorar)





una vez que tenemos las dos imágenes utilizamos la información de las dos imágenes capturadas para encontrar las correspondencias entre ellas, como lo realiza nuestra vista.

Los pasos son:

1 - Remover distorsiones radiales y tangenciales del lente; este proceso se llama (en ingles) undistortion

2 - Ajustar los ángulos y distancias entre imágenes; este proceso se llama rectificación. En este paso ya obtenemos imágenes rectificadas y alineadas

3 - Encontrar iguales puntos en las dos imágenes, esto se llama correspondencia. La salida de este proceso es una imagen llamada mapa de disparidad, donde la disparidad se refiere a la diferencia entre las dos imágenes en un mismo punto.

4 - Por ultimo, podemos pasar el mapa de disparidad a distancias utilizando triangulación; este proceso se llama reproyección y la salida es una imagen con profundidad.

Realizamos estos pasos utilizando fuertemente la librería Open CV. Esta librería nos facilita mucho la realización de cada uno de ellos. Vamos a dedicarnos fuertemente en explicar como utilizamos el mapa de disparidad.     

\subsection{Mapas de disparidad}

(agregar imagenes 12-5 pag 417 libro open cv y 12-6 pag 418 del mismo libro, tambien puede ir la imagen 12-4)

Realizando los pasos anteriores sucesivamente obtenemos el mapa de disparidad. Dicha imagen nos permite utilizar la información obtenida de las dos imágenes para saber la profundidad de cada objeto (o punto??). Veamos el concepto que se utiliza para poder armar esta imagen.

Asumamos que la imagen no posee distorsión y esta rectificada. En la figura (12-6) podemos ver la representación de la visión estéreo. Los puntos Ol y Or representan los centros de la cámara izquierda y derecha respectivamente. Los puntos pl y pr son los proyectados en cada imagen respectivamente y corresponden a un unico punto P. Este punto debe ser alineado por las dos imágenes. Si definimos como xl y xr como las coordenadas de x en cada punto respectivamente, podemos definir disparidad como d = xl - xr.

Utilizando geometría podemos calcular la distancia Z, que es inversamente proporcional al valor de disparidad. Podemos apreciar esto en la figura (12-5). Si la distancia del objeto es mayor, el valor de disparidad va a ser mas chico. Por ejemplo, si vemos un objeto a mucha distancia, la visión de cada imagen va a ver ese objeto sin poda diferencia, es por eso que su disparidad tiende a cero. Ocurre lo contrario si el objeto esta mas cercano. La relación de estas dos variables claramente no es lineal.

Cabe aclarar que para obtener buenos resultados se debe sacar las imágenes al mismo tiempo así como también rectificarlas.

\subsection{Geometría epipolar}

(agregamos figura 12-8 del mismo libro)

Para entender un poco mas como encuentra la relación entre cada punto que representan el mismo objeto vamos a ver la geometría se sucede en las cámaras. La figura (12-8) nos muestra los planos que observa cada cámara y su relación con el punto en común P. Lo mas interesante es ver que para todo punto que se ve en las dos imágenes existe una linea epipolar que atraviesa por un punto epipolo y que tiene su correlación en la otra imagen. Esta es la base de la correspondencia entre cada imagen.

Cada punto en 3D visto desde las cámaras esta contenido en un plano epipolar que intersecta cada imagen en la linea epipolar. Cuando un punto se corresponde con otro en la otra imagen debe apoyarse sobre su linea epipolar correspondiente. Gracias a esta regla, la búsqueda de cada punto con respecto a su correspondencia en la otra imagen se reduce de una búsqueda en dos dimensiones a una busqueda en una dimension , o sea sobre una linea. Esto reduce el computo significativamente.

\section{Navegación para robot móviles utilizando los mapas de disparidad}

Una vez que obtuvimos el mapa de disparidad debemos correr nuestro algoritmo de navegación. Dado un mapa de disparidad, vamos a explicar paso a paso que haría con ella.

Sobre toda la imagen de disparidad nos quedamos con una región. Esta región esta determinada entre las filas 300 y 340 de la imagen. Este corte horizontal lo utilizamos para poder decidir para que lugar moverse. Realizamos varios experimentos y llegamos a la conclusión de que es la mejor region para definir el posible camino dada la arquitectura y las condiciones utilizadas. Esta región la llamaremos región de interes, con esta vamos a continuar con los pasos de navegacion.

Cuando obtuvimos esta porción de imagen, vamos a procesarla para poder tomar una decisión con respecto a la navegación. Recorremos toda la imagen por columnas realizando la mediana de los datos por cada columna de información. (tenemos que hacer un grafico de esto.) Si la columna posee algún valor muy lejano se le asigna un valor muy grande parametrizado en el programa. Realizamos distintos experimentos y llegamos a la conclusion que la mediana  representa bastante bien la distancia de cada columna. En un principio utilizamos el promedio de los valores pero fue descartado por lo siguiente: Supongamos que poseemos 1/3 de la columna con pixeles negros. El promedio de esta columna va a estar cerca del valor de negro, descartando esa columna de informacion. Si utilizamos la mediana, los valores mayores van a estar concentrados en la parte final. Al utilizar los dos elementos del medio vamos a obtener un valor de disparidad real y no va a estar afectado a los pixeles negros. Es por eso que nos inclinamos a utilizar la mediana. Muchas veces experimentamos esto por tener imagenes con poca luminosidad por ejemplo y pudimos evitarlo de esta forma.

Luego de realizado este procesamiento sobre cada columna de la imagen, obtenemos un array de todas las distancias sugeridas por cada columna.

Si no se obtiene una cadena de datos con información suficiente como para elegir un camino a seguir, el algoritmo define una política de escape.
